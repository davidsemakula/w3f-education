# Securing the Network

Polkadot assumes that parachains are running as external untrusted clients of the relay chain and
that the relay chain only deals with parachains via an interface and does not make assumptions about
their internals. For example, internally they may be permissioned or open; if some internal users
subvert the parachain, from Polkadot's viewpoint the entire parachain (as a single client entity) is
malicious.

The Polkadot relay chain is designed to deal with a level of malicious behaviour internally, as a
requirement of being an open decentralised network. Specific individual nodes are untrusted, but an
indeterminable subset of nodes lower-bounded in size are trusted, and the protocol works to ensure
that the relay chain externally as a whole is trustable.

Polkadot does not have any security assumption on block production mechanism for parachains. The
security of Polkadot does not depend on any precise honest fraction of collators but it requires
existence of some honest collators.

Parts of the protocol assume that every parachain has at least one reachable honest member; where
this is not feasible or not realistic, we do not follow through on this assumption and instead have
additional checks against a totally-malicious membership.
