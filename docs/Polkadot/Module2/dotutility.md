# DOT Token Utility

On the side of economics, we aim to have a controlled near-constant yearly inflation rate. It is
important for the security of the system that all validators have large amounts of stake backing
them. Our adaptive reward schedule for validators and the nominators backing them ensures that
overall participation in NPoS stays high, and that the validators' stake backings are evenly
distributed. On a more granular level, we pay or slash validators on a per- executed-action basis,
and extend the same rewards or punishment onto nominators proportionally, to ensure that the
rational strategy is compatible with honest behaviour.
