# Becoming a Parachain on Polkadot

The Polkadot system consists of a single open collaborative decentralised network called the relay
chain, that interacts with many other external chains run in parallel called parachains. From a
high-level perspective, parachains are clients of the relay chain, which provides a security service
to these clients, including secure communication. That is the sole purpose of the relay chain;
parachains are the entities providing application-level functionality, such as cryptocurrencies. The
internal details of parachains are not a concern of the relay chain; parachains need only adhere to
the interface we specify. Some of these expectations are natural components of blockchains, hence
the naming. However, other non-blockchain systems may also run as a Polkadot parachain as long as
they satisfy the interface.
