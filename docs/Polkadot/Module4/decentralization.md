# Decentralization of Network

Of course, in a real-world decentralised system the networking part also must be decentralised -
it's no good if all communication passes through a few central servers, even if the high-level
protocol running on top of it is decentralised with respect to its entities. As a concrete example:
in certain security models, including the traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant setting, nodes are
modelled as possibly malicious but no consideration is given to malicious edges. A security
requirement like

> 1=3 of nodes are honest in the model, in fact translates to > 1=3 of nodes are honest and can all
> communicate perfectly reliably with each other all the time in reality. Conversely, if an edge is
> controlled by a malicious ISP in reality, it is the corresponding node(s) that must be treated as
> malicious in any analysis under the model. More significantly, if the underlying communications
> network is centralised, this can give the central parties the ability to corrupt > 1=3 of nodes
> within the model thereby breaking its security assumptions, even if they don't actually have
> arbitrary execution rights on that many nodes. In this section we outline and enumerate the
> communication primitives that we require in Polkadot, and sketch a high-level design on how we
> achieve these in a decentralised way, with the specifics to be refined as we move forward with a
> production system.
