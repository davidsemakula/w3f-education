![M for Multisig](assets/M.png)

To have true ownership of your assets on the blockchain, we use accounts, and these accounts have
addresses. An account is managed with keys: a public key with corresponding private key. Ownership
of an account can be verified by the ability to prove you have the private key, which allows you to
sign transactions. Without the private key, accounts on the blockchain are not usable. Losing your
private key is equivalent to losing your wallet forever.

Sometimes we need multiple accounts to sign off on transactions; think shared bank accounts or the
government passing a bill requiring a certain amount of signatories. This is where multi-signature
accounts come in. A multisig can comprise two or more accounts, and a signature **threshold** needs
to be defined. This value equals or is less than the number of accounts part of the multisig. The
threshold is the number of signatures required to sign the transactions on the multisig to execute
the transaction. Multisig accounts can execute any on-chain function that a regular account can,
including staking, governance, and simple transfers. However, you should exercise caution when using
a multisig for staking or crowdloans, which are time-sensitive.

**Kind of cool**

You can determine a multisig account address even if it hasn’t been generated. All you have to do is
know the accounts part of the multisig and the threshold number. Using these inputs, we can
determine the multisig address. An interesting byproduct is that you can send a transaction to a
non-existent address. If the accounts you chose to be the participants of that address were to
create the multisig sometime in the future, they could access the transaction.

For example, here, I will take the Kusama stash addresses of Binance and Kraken and set a threshold
of 2. This will generate the multisig address of those two accounts, with a threshold of 2. If I
choose to, I can send KSM to that multisig, and if Binance and Kraken teams want to access that KSM,
they would have to work together to set up the multisig.

**Some use cases**

1. Two accounts can be used as two-factor authentication(2FA) for a larger stash account. And even
   3FA, or if you choose 4FA, is possible; you can create as many
2. You can gather some friends, create a DAO or a corporation, and use a multisig account that holds
   the funds for the entity. When there is a transaction, all or most participants must sign off on
   it.
3. Multiple accounts can join forces to run for a seat on a Council.

**Be careful!**

A couple of things to be aware of; once a multisig is created, it cannot be altered! And, if someone
were to lose access to their account, which is a part of the multisig, the multisig could be
unusable, which would be very bad. In addition, a multi-sig, once created, needs to have an
existential deposit to be usable. Substrate allows runtime developers to set a fixed amount of
maximum accounts that can be a part of a multisig; in the case of Polkadot, this number is 100, and
on other Substrate chains, this value might be different.
