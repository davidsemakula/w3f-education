# What is a Blockchain?

- A data structure
- Typically an ordered, back-linked list of blocks with data.
- Each block is identified by a hash
- The hashes protect the integrity of the data

Typically, the blocks in a blockchain contain blockheaders and a payload

Although the payload could be any arbitrary data, it is mainly used for

- Record keeping - who, what, when, and why (ex: ledgers)
- Self-executing code (ex: smart contracts)
- Hashes of arbitrary data (ex: hashes of Images, videos as NFTs)

# A Few Definitions of Blockchain

"Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking assets and building
trust." - [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain)

"Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are powered by a technology called the blockchain. At
its most basic, a blockchain is a list of transactions that anyone can view and verify." -
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-blockchain)

"Blockchain technology is an advanced database mechanism that allows transparent information sharing
within a business network. A blockchain database stores data in blocks that are linked together in a
chain. The data is chronologically consistent because you cannot delete or modify the chain without
consensus from the network. As a result, you can use blockchain technology to create an unalterable
or immutable ledger for tracking orders, payments, accounts, and other transactions. The system has
built-in mechanisms that prevent unauthorized transaction entries and create consistency in the
shared view of these transactions." - [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/blockchain/)
