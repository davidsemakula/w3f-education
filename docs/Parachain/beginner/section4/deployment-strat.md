The following explores different ways one can register a parachain on Roccoco, Kusama, or Polkadot.
Keep in mind that the process of registering on Kusama versus Polkadot is quite similar, however
Kusama has more relaxed auction parameters.

## Testnet - Deploying on Roccoco

## Candle Auctions

### Canary - Deploying on Kusama

### Production - Deploying on Polkadot
