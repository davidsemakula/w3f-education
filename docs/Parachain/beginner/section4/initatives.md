## Developer Heroes

The Polkadot Developer Heroes program offers a place for builders to gather, ask questions, and
learn from one another. The programâ€™s goal is to build a strong collaborative community of Polkadot
developers, from new joiners to advanced levels, to drive the growth and evolution of the Polkadot
ecosystem, and in the meantime, to recognize, support, and elevate exceptional developers.
