Typically, a parachain slot auction would have to take place to achieve a connection with the relay chain.  These auctions can take some time - usually one week, with multiple parachains competing for a slot in the relay chain.  

One possibility is to modify our relay chain's code to lower auction times.  However, this still is unideal for development purposes.

A significant side effect of running our local relay chain includes bypassing that process via our type of governance - `sudo`.

## A Brief Introduction to the Sudo Pallet

The [`sudo`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_sudo/index.html) pallet executes calls that require `Root` origin with any keys that are declared as "sudo".  In most development environments, `Alice` is one of these keys.  Adding more keys if needed via the `set_key` extrinsic is also possible.

It primarily acts as a wrapper for other calls.  It is not meant to be used in pallets directly but rather merely execute privileged calls that require the `Root` origin.

## Using Sudo as Governance in Polkadot.js

Using the `sudo` pallet, we can bypass the auction process and register the parachain directly.  

:::caution Make sure your collator is running!

To register our parachain, we need both our relay chain creating blocks and our parachain's collator running.

:::

Navigate to the [Polkadot.js Developer Console](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/explorer), and select the `Sudo` tab:


Once here, select the `parasSudoWrapper` in the dropdown:

Upload the genesis (`parachain-genesis-state`) and runtime (`parachain-wasm`) from the `parachain-guide-resources` repository:

In the "Events" tab in the explorer, you should see two events - `sudo.Sudid` and `paras.PvfCheckAccepted`.  These should indicate that the parachain's runtime has been successfully registered, and the collator will start syncing with the relay chain.

## Ensuring Collation

Your collator should have output similar to the following: 

```sh

In Polkadot.js, you should also see block production occurring on both the relay and parachain:

If not, you may have forgotten to specify a bootnode.  You may restart your collator and specify a relay chain validator using the `--bootnodes` flag.
