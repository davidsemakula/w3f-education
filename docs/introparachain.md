# Parachain Development Guide

This guide aims to jumpstart a developer from an overview of Polkadot architecture, creating their own parachain, and going through the process of registering it to a locally available relay chain.  It contains both a brief, yet demystifying explanation of Polkadot as a sharded blockchain network and how various roles work together to provide data availability, interoperability, and shared security.

If you wish to only learn about the current relay chain and parachain architecture, then you only need to read the [first section](./Parachain/beginner/section1/index.md).  Otherwise, this guide also provides the means to begin your parachain development journey.

:::tip Suggested Prerequisites

The following courses, or knowledge of these subjects in general will aid you in smoothly following this guide:

1. [Intro to Rust](./introrust.md)
2. [Intro to Substrate](./introsubstrate.md)

:::

The primary goals are:

- Learn the basics of how Polkadot works as a **sharded** network.
- Learn the roles of the relay and parachain architecture.
- Install necessary binaries and dependencies needed to create networks locally.
- Modify your parachain and prep it for connecting to the relay chain.
- Create a parathread and reserve a para ID
- Create and run an auction, registering your parachain.
- Next steps and moving forward.
