# Introduction to Polkadot SDK - Substrate & FRAME

Developed by the Technical Education team at the Web3 Foundation, this course provides a
comprehensive overview of the Substrate blockchain framework and building blockchains.

:::note Prerequisites

Before starting, it would be wise to either have experience with Rust, or have taken our
[Intro to Rust course](introrust.md). Substrate depends heavily on Rust, and it will be elaborated
on extensively in this course.

:::

This course will provide a solid foundation in navigating the creation and modification of custom
blockchain modules, called **pallets**. This course will serve as an introduction into becoming a
Substrate developer, the factors involved, as well as a guided, hands on portion to building a
custom FRAME pallet.

In this course, you will:

- Learn about FRAME, the primary mode of implementation for Substrate
- Learn at high-level how storage, the runtime, and pallets work in FRAME
- Learn how to build a basic pallet and run a custom blockchain via a template
- Learn basic testing of a FRAME pallet
- Learn best practices and important considerations when building a FRAME pallet
- Build and deploy a basic, social-network like blockchain pallet called `connect`
