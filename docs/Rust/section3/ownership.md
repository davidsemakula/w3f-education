  Learn how the ownership model works in Rust, and why it allows for Rust to be safe at compile
  time.

As mentioned in the intro, a crucial part of Rust's safety is its memory management. **Ownership**
in Rust is the concept that defines a set of rules for how to handle memory in a Rust program. It
does not affect performance - as ownership checks happen at compile time.

While these rules may seem prohibitive, they sometimes ensure entirely memory-safe code.

:::note

If you aren't familiar with the stack and heap, make sure you
[read this first](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#the-stack-and-the-heap),
as it will provide context for why ownership is essential when dealing with collections.

## Ownership Rules

As stated in the Rust book, ownership has three primary concepts/rules:

- Every single value (statement) has an owner
- There can only be one owner at a time
- Ownership is heavily dependent on the scope. When a statement goes out of scope, the ownership is
  dropped.

These rules ensure that the ownership of a particular variable in memory is managed correctly and
appropriately. Simply put - the scope defines the ownership of a particular variable, as you will
see.

## Variable Scope

Let's run through an example to demonstrate the importance of scope and how it relates to ownership:

```rust
// You can define a new scope within main using this syntax.
// Everything within this scope is valid until the closing curly bracket.
// For example, you cannot use `x` outside of this scope - as the variable is dropped from memory

{
    // Declare an integer x
    let x = 10;
    // We can do whatever we want in the context of this scope,
    // but after it ends, we cannot use x.
}
// We cannot use `x` here!
```

In terms of ownership, the _variable `x`_ is owned by this scope, defined by curly brackets, until
the end of the scope. From here, the Rust compiler handles the de-allocation of memory in a safe
manner.

Ownership gets more complex when dealing with values not defined at compile-time. For more
information on the complexities of ownership, read the
[Rust book's explanation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html).

## What's happening here?

We define two variables here: `x` and `y`. Both are fixed size, and known at compile time. The
difference between the two is that `y` is owned by the scope of the `main` function, while `x` is
owned by another inner scope. The code illustrates that `x` is dropped after the inner scope ends,
while `y` can still be used until the end of the `main` function's scope.
