Slices are another type of reference. As the name implies, they _refer_ to a _slice_ of information,
in bytes, to an existing variable in memory.

Instead of handling an entire collection, which could be costly performance-wise, we can use slices
to handle a _reference_ to those items. These slices can be modified in place or returned as
immutable as part of a function.

## String slices

Working with string and byte slices is one of the most common tasks when working with Rust,
especially at a lower level.

A String slice is simply a reference to a part, or slice, of a String:

```rust

let name = String::from("Bader");
// We can use the `..` operator to specify a range for the slice to cover
// In this case, we want the 'Bad' from Bader
let bad_slice = &name[0..3];
println!("{bad_slice}"); // Prints "Bad"

```

The double period syntax (`..`) signifies a range. It creates a variable that represents that
specific String in memory from those specified positions (`[starting_index..ending_index]`).

## Modifying a slice in-place

It's possible to modify a mutable slice. This is also called changing it 'in place', as you are
manipulating the data within that specific starting and ending index.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    modify_in_place(&mut arr[2..4]); // pass in a mutable slice that refers to elements 3 and 4 of the array
    println!("{:?}", arr); // prints "[1, 2, 6, 8, 5]"
}

fn modify_in_place(slice: &mut [i32]) {
    for i in 0..slice.len() {
        slice[i] *= 2; // double each element in the slice
}
```

We can modify a slice, or part of the array (`arr`) versus the entire array. This way, we can only
act on the part of the data given.

## What's happening here?

The code above illustrates how to construct a basic string slice as well as return it in a function.
To make it interesting, try to pass `name` as a mutable reference - does it work? Why and why not?
