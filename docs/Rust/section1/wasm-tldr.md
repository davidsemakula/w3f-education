description: Why WASM is used, and it's support in Rust.

WebAssembly (Wasm) is becoming a core part of many technology stacks. It is a portable target for
higher-level languages to compile to and has no direct limitations on where it can run (although it
is mostly browser focused at the moment). It can run at near-native speeds and provides a sandboxed,
agnostic set of instructions to run in any environment that supports it.

Wasm has two standard formats, `.wat` and `.wasm`.

- `.wat` - a text-based format called WebAssembly Text, a more human-readable way of representing
  Wasm instructions.
- `.wasm` - a binary-based format that defines an executable that is then executed by a Wasm virtual
  machine.

WebAssembly, while not exclusive to Rust by any means, is highly supported by Rust. This enables
Rust code to be even more portable in web-based applications (or any environment that supports
WebAssembly).

:::info Forkless Upgrades, thanks to WASM

Heard of **forkless upgrades** on [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/)? It is Wasm that enables
these seamless blockchain upgrades. Each instance of the Polkadot Runtime compiles to a Wasm blob
and is stored in the blockchain's storage, which can be replaced through an on-chain
governance-based upgrade.

## Basic Wasm Architecture

At its core, Wasm is a stack-based virtual machine where each value is pulled and pushed on an
arbitrary stack. It is worth noting that Wasm is not a _register_ machine, as it contains no
context-specific registers for holding bytes.

## Wasm Use cases

On [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), Wasm is a core part of the technology stack:

- It defines reliable state transition functions for the
  [relay chain runtimes](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/glossary#runtime).
- It defines
  [Parachain Validation Functions (PVFs)](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains-protocol),
  which is a core part of how relay and parachains agree on their respective state.
- The [ink!](https://use.ink/) smart contract language compiles to Wasm, which takes full advantage
  of Wasmâ€™s sandboxed and portable nature.
