title: Intro to Advanced Rust - Traits, Generics, & Lifetimes
---

The following module deals with the concepts of traits, generics, and an overall deeper look at the
robust type system that Rust provides. Lifetimes, yet another safety mechanism to ensure that
references are living correctly within the program.

These three concepts are very often used with one another to define reusable and scalable
relationships between types in Rust.
