Iterators in Rust allow you to perform tasks sequentially on a series of items while knowing the end
of the sequence. `Iterator` is a trait that, once implemented, handles many of the nuances of safely
looping through collections. Iterators are **lazy**, meaning they are only used when called upon.

## Creating an Iterator

Most collections we discussed earlier have the `Iterator` trait already implemented. The most common
usage of iterators regards arrays or vectors, and they are often used as an alternative for loops:

```rust
let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Call the `.iter()` method on `Vec`:
let iter = my_vec.iter();
for val in iter {
    println!("Value: {}", val);
}
// Optionally, call it in-line:
let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for val in my_vec.iter() {
    println!("Value: {}", val);
}
```

You may notice that this looks familiar to a regular `for` loop. This will be discussed in more
depth in a later section, but know they are different!

## A closer look at the `Iterator` trait

Let's examine the `Iterator` trait itself:

```rust
pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
    // methods with default implementations elided
}
```

The `next()` method is the heart of an `Iterator`'s functionality, as it's the only method needed to
implement the `Iterator` trait. `next()` returns the next item as `Some(value)` from the iterator,
and returns `None` once it's complete.

Notice that although `Iterator` can iterate over many types, it uses an associated type, `Item`.
Using an associated type allows the type implementing the trait to specify the desired outcome,
versus a generic would have the developer impose some type that may be incorrect.

## "Consuming" An Iterator & Iterator Methods

As a result of implementing `Iterator`, one can use a few key methods to modify a sequence of items.
For more information on available methods, it is highly encouraged to read through the Rust
documentation for the [`Iterator`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html) trait.

Some methods consume an iterator, meaning they call the `next( )` method within their
implementation. An example is `.sum()`, which collectively adds all items by calling `next()` until
the iterator has reached its end:

```rust
let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = my_vec.iter().sum();
```

The `.map()` method is very commonly used. It takes a closure, performs an operation over each item
in the iterator, and returns an iterator. This does not modify the previous iterator, rather it
returns a new one with modified values:

```rust
let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// Returns a new iterator that adds `1` to each item
my_vec.iter().map(|x| x + 1);
```

Another method that operates similarly is `filter()` , which returns an iterator of filtered values
based on a conditional statement within the closure:

```rust
let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// Returns a new iterator that adds `1` to each item
my_vec.iter().filter(|x| *x % 2 == 0);
```

### Using .collect()

Using `collect()`, you can gather the values of an iterator and back into a vector that represents
the operation you performed on it:

```rust
let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// Returns a new iterator containing only even numbers
let filter_iter = my_vec.iter().filter(|x| *x % 2 == 0);
// Returns a new iterator that adds `1` to each item
let map_iter = my_vec.iter().map(|x| x + 1);

// Collect into a filtered Vec
let even: Vec<_> = filter_iter.collect(); // [2, 4]
// Collect into a mapped Vec
let plus_one: Vec<_> = map_iter.collect(); // [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

```

As some of these methods return an iterator, it's possible to chain them:

```rust
// Both maps then filter on the returned iterator from `map`
let chained_iter = my_vec.iter().map(|x| x + 1).filter(|x| *x % 2 == 0);
```

## Loops vs Iterators - when to use which?

In the previous section, a piece of code looked just like a `for` loop that was covered in the Loops
module:

```rust
    let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    for val in my_vec.iter() {
        println!("Value: {}", val);
    }
```

At first glance, this appears to be the same syntax and functionality as a normal `for` loop:

```rust
    let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    for val in my_vec {
        println!("Value: {}", val);
    }
```

Both serve the same purpose but behave differently. Iterators operate on **references**, whereas a
`for` loop directly takes possession of the value for the loop's scope. Calling:

```rust
for val in my_vec.iter() {}
```

It is effectively the same as calling:

```rust
for val in &my_vec {}
```

It is generally a better design decision to utilize a reference-based approach, as `my_vec` would be
unusable after a traditional `for` loop that takes ownership.

## What's going on here?

The code features a collection of various iterators stemming from the same `Vec`, `my_vec`.
Iterators do not directly modify the `Vec`. Rather each operation returns a new iterator with values
that may be modified, which is the case with `map()`.
