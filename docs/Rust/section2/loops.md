flow.

# Basic Logic Flows

Logic flows, sometimes called control flows, allow for conditional statements, such as `if`, to be
possible. It allows for branching logic to be implemented for a program based on `boolean` values.

## Using `if`

As said before, implementing logic based on whether something is true or not would be very useful
`if` statements are the cornerstone of conditional logic.

```rust
let this_is_true: bool = true;

if this_is_true {
    println!("Less trust, more truth!");
}
```

The above code showcases a very simple example. The statement `this_is_true` is set to a boolean
value, `true`, which will execute the code within the brackets when evaluated by the `if` statement.

It's also possible to use an exclamation mark (`!`) to further diverge logic:

```rust
let this_is_true: bool = true;
if !this_is_true {
    println!("Less trust, more truth!");
}

```

This no longer prints, as it looks for the opposite of `true` - `false`.

A more realistic example is checking if a number is higher or lower than expected, like seeing if a
bank balance is over $100.

```rust
let bank_balance = 101;
if bank_balance >= 100 {
    println!("More than 100 dollars");
}
```

## Using `else if` and `else`

A single `if` statement can only be used so much. Using `else if`, we can create branches of logic
within a program:

```rust
let bank_balance = 56;

if bank_balance >= 100 {
    println!("More than, equal to, 100 dollars");
} else if bank_balance % 2 == 0 {
    println!("You have an even balance!");
} else if bank_balance <= 0 {
    println!("Uh oh, it appears you're in debt!");
} else {
    println!("More than 0, but less than 100!");
}
```

## Using `match`

You can also use a match statement to perform similar logic, which we will investigate later. A
`match` statement is the most basic form of pattern matching:

```rust
let age = 18;

match age {
    16 => println!("Old enough to drive"),
    18 => println!("An adult"),
    _ => println!("Irrelevant age")
}

```

# Iterating with loops

Loops in Rust are very useful _expressions_, which, if you recall, produce a value as a result of
some operation.

Although Rust supports
[five types of loops](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/loop-expr.html), we will go
over the most common types:

- The `loop` expression - an infinite loop which goes till `break` is called.
- The `while` expression - a loop that continues until a condition is true or false.
- The `for` expression - a loop that is useful for iterating over a collection of items.

## Infinite loops: `loop`

Using the `loop` keyword, we can define an expression that iterates, or loops, infinitely:

```rust
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("Print forever!");
    }
}
```

This type of loop is typically used to keep trying some operation until a condition has been
fulfilled.

## Conditional loops: `while`

A `while` loop will automatically stop once a condition has been fulfilled. An example would be
looping until a number has reached a certain limit:

```rust

fn main() {
    let mut x = 0;
    while (x <= 10) {
        println!("x is now: {x}");
        x += 1;
    }
}

```

In this case, we define a mutable variable `x`. The while loop, which defines a condition while x is
less than or equal to `10` (`x <= 10`), executes the logic until the condition for `x` is met.

A while loop could also iterate over a collection if needed:

```rust

fn main() {
    let months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"];
    let mut index = 0;
    while (index <= months.len() - 1) {
        println!("The month is now: {}", months[index]);
        index += 1;
    }
}

```

This is a bit clumsy, not to mention not friendly to any updates to the `months` array - an index
could be out of bounds if we add or take away any elements from the array. Luckily, there is a
better way to accomplish this.

## Looping over collections: `for`

The `for` loop is primarily used for looping over a collection of items, such as an array. You may
recall that we used a `for` loop to loop over several course modules.

Let's refactor the code from `while` to `for`:

```rust

fn main() {
    let months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"];
    for month in months{
        println!("The month is now: {}", month);
    }
}

```

Besides being much more concise, there is no worry about having an `index out of bounds` error.

## What is happening here?

All the core loops are illustrated above. Notice the `break` keyword being used within `loop`, so
the playground does not run infinitely (and so other loops can run!).
