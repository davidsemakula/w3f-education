# Introduction to Rust for Blockchain Development

Developed by the Technical Education team at the Web3 Foundation, this course introduces programming
in Rust for Blockchain applications.

This course follows the free textbook
[The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) by Steve Klabnik and Carol
Nichols, with the addition of hands-on examples, in-browser executable snippets, and some patterns
commonly found in blockchain-based development.

This course is designed to teach the fundamentals of Rust to people who know the basics of
programming in another language, and are curious about why Rust is used and how to use it.

This course provides a strong foundation in general-purpose Rust. Also, it emphasizes some aspects
of Rust (such as `[no_std]`, advanced traits, and the use of Rust & Wasm development toolchain) that
are particularly useful when developing with the [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) blockchain
framework.
